IDEA: Tinkers' Wizardry

Adds various magic-related things to Tinkers' Construct.

Planned:

    - Spells: Basically fancy interaction abilities
        + Spells exclusively consume Overslime, as "mana"
        + All spells will have a cooldown (perhaps be able to mitigate the cooldown to some degree with another modifier?)
        + Projectile Spells
            - Fireball
            - Slimeball: Inflicts status effects on target, depending on the type of slime.
            - Snowball (why not?)
            - Shulker projectile
        + Conjuration Spells (Summon stuff)
        + Hexes (Directly applied to entities)


    - Wand: Multipart ranged weapon that fires magical bolts.
        + Can be modified with the same modifiers as bows, generally
        + Exclusive abilities (names pending):
            - Rockbreaking: Bolts can break/drop blocks - Luck will not be applied
            - Interacting: Bolts can perform simple interactions with targetted blocks (doors, buttons, etc.)
            -
